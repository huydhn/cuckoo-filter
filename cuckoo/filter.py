'''
A Cuckoo filter is a data structure for probabilistic set-membership queries
with a low false positive probability (FPP). As an improvement over the
classic Bloom filter, items can be added or removed into Cuckoo filters
at will. Cuckoo filter also utilizes space more efficiently.

Cuckoo filters were originally described in:
    Fan, B., Andersen, D. G., Kaminsky, M., & Mitzenmacher, M. D. (2014, Dec).
    Cuckoo filter: Practically better than bloom.

    Networking Experiments and Technologies (pp. 75-88). ACM.

        initial_capacity: The initial size of the filter, it defines how many
            buckets the first filter contains.

        error_rate: The desired error rate, the lower the error rate and the
            bigger the bucket size, the longer the fingerprint needs to be.

        bucket_size : The maximum number of fingerprints a bucket can hold.
            The default size is 4, which closely approaches the best size for
            FPP between 0.00001 and 0.002 (see Fan et al.).  Also according to
            the author, if your targeted FPP is greater than 0.002, a bucket
            size of 2 is more space efficient.

        max_kicks : The number of times entries are kicked / moved around
            before the filter is considered full.  Defaults to 500 used by
            Fan et al. in the above paper.
